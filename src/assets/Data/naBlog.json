    "entry": "After a month of downtime while Clint at Gas Head Motorworks swapped a front-subframe due to an incident I had being run off the road and into a curb, I finally got her back! And she even has a set of shiny new 94 hollow spoke wheels! New tires too, we decided to go with the Falken SINCERA SN250 A/S, a 720 treadwear all-season which had the best overall rating on TireRack.com and knowing full well that they will age out in 5 years and require replacement long before the tread ever wears out. \n\n The drive home from Clint's shop was an interesting one to say the least... We had a Mazda Comp shock on the front temporarily while I was waiting for the Xida XL replacement shock to arrive, and the tires were brand new, and the car was running a shoe-string alignment just to get it home. So I was being super careful as the spongy tires darted and moved all over the road with almost no grip as the mold-release was still instact. And of course, it had to start raining on the drive back. \n But all of that didn't matter, even the slight amount of drifitng I did on the exit ramp from highway 290 onto 610 north didn't phase my happiness in drviving the old girl again. It quite litterally brought a tear to my eye. \n \n After another 3 weeks I finally got her replacement Xida XL shock in from 949 Racing and I was able to get her back on the road after another visit to Clint to get the new shock installed and the alignment done. I have to say, I missed her a lot. I'm glad to have her back."
