    "entry": "Kasumi got some TLC today down at the Shop Club Houston. \n What's really great about the Shop Club is that every wash bay has a foam cannon and a full scope of products, including bug-remover, wheel and tire cleaner, car soap, a wash bucket with a grit-gaurd in place at the bottom, a car-soap pre-mixing machine, and the option to use hot water. \n I brought a second 5 gallon wash bucket with a grit gaurd for rinsing the wash mitt I also brought with me. They do provide wash mitts, but I only use those for washing the wheels. \n After the wash phase I moved over to the detailing bay and dried the car. I then went over her with the Chemical Guys Ceramic Detailer, which they claim can act as a stand-alone product for paint protection... I'm not entirely convinced it's going to hold up over the next couple of months or a couple of repeat washings. \n \n I also took the time to clean the interior and vacuum the carpets and I have to say, I am really happy with how she looks now, although I did find some issues on the front bumper re-paint form Best Colision that I will need to bring up with them as soon as I have a chance to get back over there."
