        "entry": "This weekend was a great road-trip with my brother out to Austin Texas to see “Stop Making Sense” by The Talking Heads in IMAX. \n Great movie, one of the all-time great concerts on film. The next day, we took off for Lime Creek Rd, a somewhat famous twisty road for driving and biking enthusiast with a reputation for being quite challenging. \n\n Hangovers abound the next morning from a night of fun, I didn’t attack the road in my usual enthusiastic style. But it was still a lot of fun and Kasumi performed beautifully, responding to every slight input on the throttle as well as it’s soft springs could possibly manage. \n The engine is still a joy to ring out, and on the KPC (Kinematic Posture Control) system did a good job of tightening the line when needed with a minor steering adjustment and keeping the body roll in check with the now worn-out OEM tires. \n I would say the one spot where the ND chassis never really does well, is the ride quality. The Bilstein dampers that come equipped will cause the tires to skip and chatter over various surfaces, and the oscillations from front to rear even on a smoother highway are rather ridiculous. It’s a weird case of too soft yet too firm linear-damper that feel very mismatched to the stock spring-rate. \n I suppose this is a good reason the car has an excellent AC system and the Apple/Android Auto infotainment system that try their best to distract you from the ride over the long haul.\n\n The best part of the trip however, was my brother suggesting and us executing an impromtu visit to the Blanco Pizza Company in Banco Texas. The pizza was absolutely amazing. The tomato sauce is more on the acid side avoiding the commercial-grade sweetness that most places use. The crust was thin and crispy, and the cheese was a perfect blend of mozzarella and parmesan. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area... Or making a trip to Lime Creek Rd."

        "entry": "I began noticing some strange handling behavior when turning left, like the inside rear wasn’t keeping contact with the road. A little weird, but another tip-off that something was amiss was the sudden degradation in ride quality.\n Some bouncy behavior is normal on these cars with the stock Bilsteins, but this was way more than normal. \n I began looking the car over and I found that the ride height was really off. So I took it over to GHM since she was due for an alignment anyway, where we promptly found that the lowest corner (driver’s rear) had a wet shock absorber.  This would indicate that the seal has failed, the monotube has lost its gas charge, and now oil was seeping out of the shock. Well good thing I still have my bumper-to-bumper warranty! Or so I thought…\n\n I took the car into the dealer I bought it from, Jeff Haas Mazda for its regular service and explained to them the situation with the shock. To probably nobody’s surprise but my own, they denied that the shock had a problem and then attempted to tell me that a Bilstein leaking fluid was “totally normal” for them. \n Well, that’s strike one. Strike two would happen just a little later when I was called and told that the same tire on that corner had a nail in it and that was probably what I had felt…. Right.\n Well, as if this could not get any more hilarious, I was also told that the nail was in an un-patchable spot (it wasn’t) and they couldn’t get the replacement tire. I told them to leave the car alone, just air of the tire and I’ll take it home. I did, and what do I find? They had already pulled the nail out without sourcing a replacement tire and the spot the nail was at was totally patchable, which I proceeded to do myself.\n As far as the leaking shock goes, I sourced a set of 500 mile replacement shocks for $100 dollars from a friend, so I’ll be doing that myself. Although, I am tempted to buy a set of Tecna coil-overs from 949 racing instead of going with the same Bilsteins… \n\n At the end of the day, Jeff Haas Mazda lost a customer, as did Mazda in general as I won’t buy from a company that won’t stand by its product."

        "entry": "Kasumi got some TLC today down at the Shop Club Houston. \n What's really great about the Shop Club is that every wash bay has a foam cannon and a full scope of products, including bug-remover, wheel and tire cleaner, car soap, a wash bucket with a grit-gaurd in place at the bottom, a car-soap pre-mixing machine, and the option to use hot water. \n I brought a second 5 gallon wash bucket with a grit gaurd for rinsing the wash mitt I also brought with me. They do provide wash mitts, but I only use those for washing the wheels. \n After the wash phase I moved over to the detailing bay and dried the car. I then went over her with the Chemical Guys Ceramic Detailer, which they claim can act as a stand-alone product for paint protection... I'm not entirely convinced it's going to hold up over the next couple of months or a couple of repeat washings. \n \n I also took the time to clean the interior and vacuum the carpets and I have to say, I am really happy with how she looks now, although I did find some issues on the front bumper re-paint form Best Colision that I will need to bring up with them as soon as I have a chance to get back over there."

        "entry": "Kasumi hit the big 23,000 mile mark today. \n Started doing the math on it, and I realized I'll be running out of warranty on time instead of mileage for the first time ever in my entire life. \n I have never owned a car that I didn't drive into the ground, and this is the first time I've ever had a car that I didn't drive into the ground.... Outside of the Corvette of course. \n I guess it's a sign of maturity or something, but it is strange for me and my typical cycle of behavior. \n I also decided to give the Chemical Guys Spray-On Ceramic Detailer a shot to see how it does overall compared to a full day's worth of applying the Meguirar's ceramic out of the bottle. So far, it's been applied as easy as any spray-on detailer, and the results so far have been decent. But we're still in the short term test phase of only a few weeks. \n We'll have to see how it holds up over the next month or so to really gauge how durable it is. \n"

        "entry": "This summer has easily been the most rain-filled summer I can remember in recent history for the Houston area. \n As a result of the ever crazy weather I have been forced to retire the Falken Azenis RT660 tires early due to their terrible performance in standing water. Instead, I have mounted a new set of Continental Extreme Contact 2 summer performance tires, which feature a softer sidewall for improved comfort and a tread design and rubber compound that is much better suited for wet weather performance. \n I have to say, the difference is night and day. The ride quality is much improved, and the wet weather performance is far superior to the Falkens in every regard. \n Of course, there are trade offs. For one, the sidewall does lead to slightly less responsive handling, and the tires do sacrifice a bit of grip on dry pavement and are not as stable in straightline braking compared to the Falkens, or even the OEM Bridgestones. But to be honest, this are are barely anything to write about, and the Contis do feel well matched in their grip levels to the chassis tuning and performance alignment with the stock suspension setup. \n I waited until I had a decent amount of miles ont hem before posting this entry, currently have 2100 miles on the Contis as of posting this and they feel pretty good.s"
