    "entry": "Today was Panda's first Autocross event of the 2025 season, and we had a blast! We ran with the local Lone Star Region Porsche Club of America (PCA) chapter at the Houston Police Academy. \n The course was definitely not a stock Corvette friendly course, and featured many decreasing radius turns which required a more momentum-car driving line with the driver-rear tire taking the majority of the abuse having to bleed-off speed as the radius would tighten up. \n But that said, it was still a ton of fun, and the Nanking Sportnex CR-S V2 tires continue to impress us with how easy they are to drive fast out of the gate and how easily they handle back to back co-driver runs. \n I was able to squeak out a 2nd place trophy in the X3 class out of six drivers, with my co-driver coming in 4th only  and we are looking forward to the next event in April."
