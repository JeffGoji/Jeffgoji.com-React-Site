        <strong>Bumpstops</strong> are a crucial component of a vehicle's suspension system, designed to limit the travel of the suspension and prevent damage to the vehicle's components. They are typically made of rubber or foam and are located at the end of the suspension travel, where they compress when the suspension reaches its maximum extension. Bumpstops help to absorb shock and provide a smoother ride by preventing metal-to-metal contact between suspension components.

        In addition to protecting the suspension system, bumpstops also play a role in tuning the vehicle's handling characteristics. By adjusting the size and stiffness of the bumpstops, engineers can fine-tune the suspension's response to bumps and dips in the road, improving overall ride quality and handling performance.

              With that out of the way, let's get into the nitty gritty of Bumpstops. If you have driving a car in the last 30 years, you have driven a car that not only uses the bumpstops to limit suspension travel, but also uses them as a tuning aid to affect the ride quality and handling of the car. When you are driving in stock-class Autocross where we are rule limited to shocks and bumpstop changes only, on a weak-spring car like a Mazda Miata, bumpstops are your friend as they can provide additional spring rate and affect the balance of the car in ways that are not possible without changing the springs.

              Now when it comes to choosing the right bumpstops for your car, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you need to consider the type of driving you will be doing. Are you going to be driving on the street, or are you going to be racing? If you're going to be racing, you'll want to choose a bumpstop that is designed for that type of driving. If you're going to be driving on the street, you'll want to choose a bumpstop that is designed for that type of driving.

              There are two types of bumpstops: <strong>progressive</strong> and <strong>linear</strong>. Progressive bumpstops are designed to compress more as they are loaded, providing a softer initial feel and then becoming progressively stiffer as they compress further. Linear bumpstops, on the other hand, provide a consistent level of resistance throughout their travel.
          </p>
          <p className="text-start">
              A very important thing to keep in mind is that bumpstops are not just a "one size fits all" solution. Different vehicles and different driving styles require different bumpstop setups. For example, a car that is primarily used for street driving may benefit from a softer, more progressive bumpstop setup, while a car that is used for track racing may require a stiffer, more linear setup.
