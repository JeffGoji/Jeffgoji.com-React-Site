                    <strong>Compression damping</strong> is the resistance a shock absorber provides when its piston is pushed inward—when the wheel moves upward relative to the car body (over a bump, dip, or during body roll). Inside the damper, hydraulic fluid must flow through tiny orifices or past adjustable shims/valves; the smaller the opening (or the stiffer the shim stack), the more resistance the fluid encounters, and the firmer the compression damping feels.

                                By resisting rapid compression, it prevents the suspension from collapsing too quickly over large bumps or under heavy loads (e.g., braking dive or rear squat under acceleration).

                                Stiffer compression damping slows how quickly weight shifts to the front or rear, sharpening turn-in response and limiting pitch motions; softer damping lets the car settle more gradually, improving comfort but at the cost of sharper handling.

                                <strong>Higher compression damping</strong> → firmer ride, reduced body motion, less brake dive, but can feel harsh and may cause the tire to “skate” over small bumps if the suspension can’t react quickly enough.

                            <li>
                                <strong>Lower compression damping</strong> → smoother, more compliant ride, better small-bump absorption and mechanical grip, but increased body motions (roll/pitch) and a “wallowy” feeling under sudden maneuvers.

                            <li>
                                Many performance shock systems split bump damping into <strong>low-speed</strong> (motions under ~0.1 m/s piston velocity—body roll, brake dive, pitch) and <strong>high-speed</strong> (quick hits like potholes or curbs). Tuning each separately lets you dial in a composed, responsive feel without making the ride punishing on broken pavement.
