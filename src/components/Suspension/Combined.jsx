            <p>
                The magic of a well-tuned suspension lies in how bump (compression) and rebound damping work <strong>together</strong> to control both <strong>how quickly</strong> the wheel moves up <em>and</em> how quickly it comes back down. It’s not enough to dial each in isolation—what feels right on the bump stroke will only stay right if the rebound stroke is matched to it.
            </p>

                    <strong>Cycle control &amp; tire contact</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If <strong>compression</strong> is very firm but <strong>rebound</strong> is too soft, the damper will resist wheel travel into the bump but then snap back too quickly—unloading the tire and sacrificing grip on the next bump.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Conversely, very firm <strong>rebound</strong> with soft <strong>compression</strong> lets the wheel dive easily into a bump and then drags it back so slowly that the chassis “sits” on the bump mid-stroke, again upsetting traction.
                        </li>

                    <strong>Energy balance &amp; heat management</strong>

                        <li>
                            Every time the shock cycles it must dissipate kinetic energy as heat. Ideally you want roughly equal energy absorption on each stroke. Mismatched valving shifts heat into one half of the cycle, which can lead to fade or inconsistent feel when the damper heats up.

                        <li>
                            Together, bump and rebound set the “natural” frequency of your suspension’s back-and-forth motion. If rebound is too light relative to compression, you’ll get a quick “chatter” after a bump (too much high-frequency motion). If rebound is too stiff, the chassis feels sluggish and won’t settle between inputs.

                        <li>
                            Under braking, you compress the front struts. Compression damping resists dive; rebound damping then controls the pace at which the car comes back up when you release the brakes. Too much imbalance here makes the car pitch forward or rearward uncontrollably between braking zones.

                    <strong>Mid-stroke “packing” vs. “porpoising”</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If rebound &gt; compression, the shock can “pack” (stay compressed) over a series of bumps because it won’t extend fast enough between impacts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If compression &gt; rebound, you risk “porpoising”—the wheel skips off the road because it rebounds too fast and then smacks back down.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                In practice, tuners start by matching <strong>low-speed</strong> compression and rebound to control body motions (roll and brake dive) in a balanced way, then dial in <strong>high-speed</strong> settings so that the car both soaks up sharp hits and recovers smoothly without oscillation. The goal is a single, coherent damper response rather than two disparate halves.
