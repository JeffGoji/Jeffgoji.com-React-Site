                    <strong>Rebound damping</strong> is the resistance a shock absorber provides when its piston is pulled outward—i.e., when the wheel moves downward relative to the car body (after compressing, as the suspension “re‐extends”). Inside the damper, hydraulic fluid must flow back through orifices or shim stacks; restricting that flow controls how quickly the suspension returns toward its ride height.

                <strong>Key functions of rebound damping:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Controls extension rate:</strong> By resisting rapid extension, it prevents the suspension from “popping” back too quickly after hitting a bump, which could unload the tire and reduce traction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Manages weight transfer recovery:</strong> Stiffer rebound damping slows the body’s return to equilibrium, smoothing out oscillations after braking, acceleration, or cornering; softer damping allows a quicker return but can lead to a bouncy, unsettled feel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Influences ride comfort vs. control trade-off:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Higher rebound damping</strong> &rarr; car settles more gradually, reducing successive oscillations and maintaining tire contact, but can feel like the chassis is being “tied down” and may lead to a harsher note as the damper drags.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Lower rebound damping</strong> &rarr; suspension feels more compliant on repeated or rhythm bumps, but can oscillate or “porpoise,” especially under heavy loads or aggressive inputs.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Most adjustable dampers break rebound into <strong>low-speed</strong> (body motions, pitch change, roll recovery) and <strong>high-speed</strong> (reacting to quick successive impacts). Tuning these independently lets you achieve smooth, controlled extension without sacrificing the ability to follow fine surface detail.
